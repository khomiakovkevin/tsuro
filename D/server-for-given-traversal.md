#Notes to Other Group

- The specification didn't make it clear as to how to add edges to the Labyrinth between nodes.
The labyrinth that was implemented here contains a method `addEdge` which will add an edge between
the two inputted nodes in the Labyrinth. Information on the added method can be found in the javadocs
in `Labyrinth.java`.
