# Rules Testing Directions

To run a specific test file, invoke the executable with a single
command line argument, which should be the file name of the
desired test.

In other words, run the following:

```
./xrules rules-testN.json
```

for any N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. All other command line arguments will
cause an error.
