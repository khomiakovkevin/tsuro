# Testing Directions for Referee and Observer

To run a specific test file, invoke the relevant executable with a
single command line argument, which should be the file name of the
desired test.

In other words, run the following:

```
./xref ref-testN.json
```

or

```
./xobs obs-testN.json
```

for any N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. All other command line arguments will
cause an error.
